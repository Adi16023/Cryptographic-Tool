# Cryptographic-Tool
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

# Symmetric, Asymmetric and Hashing:
Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext. While symmetric encryption is an older method of encryption, it is faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption.Unfortunately, symmetric encryption does come with its own drawbacks. Its weakest point is its aspects of key management.

Asymmetric encryption, also known as Public-Key cryptography, is an example of one type. Unlike “normal” (symmetric) encryption, asymmetric encryption encrypts and decrypts the data using two separate yet mathematically-connected cryptographic keys. These keys are known as a 'Public Key' and a 'Private Key. The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.

Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database.Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. With a properly designed algorithm, there is no way to reverse the hashing process to reveal the original password.
